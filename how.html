<h2 class="center">How to accept submissions and prepare proofs for printing</h2>

<i>These instructions were prepared by Marcel Goh on 16 October 2025. They are intended for new editors to
    understand our process for accepting submissions and typesetting them for the printer.</i>

<h3 class="center">The overall timeline</h3>

<p>
After decisions have been made, this is the timeline of events.

<ol>
    <li>Editors notify authors of acceptance individually</li>
    <li>Editors settle all required edits with authors</li>
    <li>Editors send formatted text to typesetter (me)</li>
    <li>I send proofs to authors for final verification</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="center">1. Notifying authors</h3>

<p>
Once decisions have been made, the selected pieces will be listed in a spreadsheet, and the selected
authors will be divided among the editors. There will be cells in the spreadsheet to keep track of how far
along in the process we are with each piece. Once the whole spreadsheet is green,
we'll be ready for the printers!
</p>
<p>
Each editor should
notify their authors individually that we want to publish their piece, and ask whether it's already been
taken. We also request First North American Serial Rights from them, ask whether they'll be able
to attend the launch, and whether they want to reserve copies at contributor pricing.
All of this has been done many times in the past, so you can search our
email archives for a template, and edit the author's name, name of the work, etc. accordingly.
</p>

<h3 class="center">2. Settling edits</h3>

<p>
Once your author has confirmed the piece is still available, it's time to square away the edits that you
want to make to the piece. If the piece requires no modification whatsoever, you may skip this step.
</p>
<p>
Either by annotating their document or just listing the requested changes in the text
of the email, ask the author whether
they're O.K. with the changes you want to make, and whether they want to make any additional or alternative
edits. This may involve a back-and-forth exchange of multiple emails, and is usually the most time-consuming
part of this whole process.
</p>

<h3 class="center">3. Formatting text for typesetting</h3>

<p>
When you are done with the previous step, you will either have a Word or Google document with all the
changes done, or the original PDF, plus a list of author-approved changes. Either way, you'll need to copy
the text into a .txt file (you can make this type of file using e.g., Notepad on Windows or TextEdit
on Mac). For documents, this is as easy as just copying the text over. For PDFs, you may have to use a
PDF-to-text converter online.
</p>

<p>
After converting to .txt, you'll see that all the formatting information has been lost. You'll have
to add it back in using a markup language that the Ahoy typesetting program understands.
<ul>
    <li><i>Italics</i> are denoted by <tt>{\it ... }</tt>.</li>
    <li><b>Bold</b> is denoted by <tt>{\bf ... }</tt>.</li>
    <li>Numerals are denoted by <tt>{\os ... }</tt>.</li>
    <li>Small-caps are denoted by <tt>{\sc ... }</tt>.</li>
    <li>All-caps abbreviations should be put in medium-caps using <tt>{\mc ... }</tt>.</li>
    <li>Periods that don't end sentences should have the tilde symbol placed after them.</li>
    <li>Paragraphs should be separated by a line of whitespace</li>
    <li>Make sure the opening and closing quotes are smart quotes (“ and ”, not "). If this isn't
        automatically done by Word or Google, you can write <tt>``</tt> for “ and <tt>''</tt> for
        ”. [This is a fairly tedious step. Feel free to skip it, but if you do, just let me know.]
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example story.</p>

<pre>
<b>The Piper</b>

by Jane Smith

There once was a man named Pierre P. Hamelin who lived at 17 Sherbrooke Street. One day he saw on the
TV that the mayor would pay one million dollars for a solution to the city's squirrel problem.

"I can get rid of the squirrels," announced Pierre at the city hall.

The mayor said sure
and Pierre played a special song on his boom box that turned all the acorns into magic acorns.
After eating the acorns, the squirrels each stepped into traffic one by one.

"I've come for my pay," said Pierre, after finishing the job.

The mayor did not pay. <i>Well I don't need to pay this guy, he already killed all the squirrels,</i> she thought.

So Pierre played a new song on his boom box that made all the city's bike lanes disappear.
All the hipsters moved to Toronto and the mayor was voted out of office.
</pre>

<p>
The way you would enter it into the .txt file is as follows.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
\bookheader{\it Jane Smith}{\it The Piper}

\preambleheader{THE PIPER}{Jane Smith}

One day he saw on the {\mc TV} that the mayor would pay one million dollars for a

(Don't worry about the "bookheader" and "preambleheader" tags if you're confused about them.
I can always add them myself later.)
The Ahoy typesetting program will read this and produce the following output.

<p>
There's a lot of stuff to keep track of, so don't worry about getting everything. I will look over
everything again and fix anything you've missed, but just try to get as much of the formatting done
as possible to lighten my workload.
</p>
<p>
You can concatenate everything into one .txt file or have multiple .txt files. There'll be a designated
place in the Google Drive to upload these files.
</p>

<h3 class="center">4. Proofs sent to authors</h3>

<p>
Once the texts have been formatted and converted into PDF by the Ahoy typesetting program, I'll send
the PDFs to the authors to make sure they're happy with how their work will appear in the final magazine.
There's nothing that you editors have to do at this stage, but if there
are discrepancies between what are in the proofs and what the authors intended, I'll have to refer
to the email threads you made with the authors, so make sure that there is a clear record of all
agreements you reach. (Otherwise I'll have to DM you to ask for more details!)
