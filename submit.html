<p>
We have two submission periods: one beginning in <b>February</b> for our spring issue,
and one beginning in <b>August</b> for our fall issue. Submissions outside these windows will be <b>ignored.</b>
</p>
<p>
You may submit any previously unpublished writing in English, French, or Spanish.
Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere. We aim to respond to
all submissions within three months.
</p>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to <b>four</b> poems of any length per call.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prose:</b> Submit only <b>one</b> prose piece per call.
We accept both short fiction and creative non-fiction (in your cover letter,
let us know which category your work falls under). For prose we have a soft limit of <b>3000 words;</b> that is,
we will not automatically disregard work exceeding this word count, but do understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.
</p>
<p>
We do not accept writing generated by artificial intelligence, and
submissions that are sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or racist will also be rejected immediately.
</p>
<p>
Send your submission as an email attachment to
<a href="mailto:ahoyliterary@gmail.com">ahoyliterary@gmail.com</a>.
In your email, be sure to include a short bio (max. 100 words) written in the third person.
We read submissions <b>blind;</b> do not include any identifying information in the attached file
containing your writing.
</p>
<p>
Please format the subject line of your email as follows:
<p>
<p class="center">
<code>[PROSE/POETRY] [SPRING/FALL] [YEAR]: [Your name]</code>
</p>
<p>
For example: <b>POETRY SPRING 1907: Rainer Maria Rilke</b>.
If you wish to submit both prose and poetry during
one submission call, please send two separate emails.
Each submission should consist of one file (.TXT, .DOCX, or .PDF are all fine).
Do not copy your writing directly into the body of your email.
