We have two submission periods: one beginning in <b>February</b> for our summer issue,
and one beginning in <b>August</b> for our winter issue. Submissions normally stay open for 2-3 months
until we have enough submissions. Check our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ahoyliterary/">Instagram</a>
page for up-to-date information.
</p>
<p>
If you are thinking of submitting your work, please note the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing must be previously unpublished and written in either English, French, or Spanish.</li>
    <li>Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
        inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Submissions that are sexist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, or generated by artificial
        intelligence will be rejected immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to <b>four</b> poems of any length per call.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fiction and creative non-fiction:</b>
For these submissions we have a soft limit of <b>3000 words;</b> that is,
we will not automatically disregard work exceeding this word count, but do understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.</li>
</p>

<p>
Send your submission as an email attachment to
<a href="mailto:ahoyliterary@gmail.com">ahoyliterary@gmail.com</a>.
In your email, be sure to: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Format the subject line of your email as follows:</p>
        <b>[POETRY/FICTION/CNF] [WINTER/SUMMER] [YEAR]: [Your name]</b><br>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">For example: <b>POETRY WINTER 1907: Rainer Maria Rilke</b></p></li>
    <li>Attach the full submission as one file (.TXT, .DOCX, or .PDF are all fine).</li>
    <li>Eliminate any identifying information from the attached file, as we read submissions <b>blind</b>.</li>
    <li>Include a short bio (max. 100 words) written in the third person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We reserve the right to ignore any submissions not adhering to the above guidelines.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to submit both prose and poetry during
one submission call, please send two separate emails. These will be assessed separately; i.e.,
if you receive a rejection for the poetry piece, this does not mean the prose has been rejected.
You may <b>not</b> submit both fiction and creative non-fiction in the same call.
