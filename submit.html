Submission guidelines
</h2>
<p>
We have two submission periods: 1 January to 31 March for our spring issue,
and 1 July to 31 September for our fall issue.
Submissions outside these windows will be disregarded.
All submissions must be previously unpublished. Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere. We aim to respond to
all submissions within three months.
</p>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to four poems, of any length, per call.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prose:</b> Please submit only one prose piece per call.
We accept both short fiction and creative non-fiction (please tell us which category your work falls
under in your cover letter). For prose we have a soft word limit of 3000 words.
This means we will not immediately disregard work that exceeds this limit, but please understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.
</p>
<p>
We do not accept writing that is sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or racist. Such submissions will be rejected
immediately.
</p>
<p>
Submissions should be sent to ahoyliterary@gmail.com with the subject line formatted as follows:
<p>
<p class="center">
<code>[GENRE] [SEASON] [YEAR]: [Your name]</code>
</p>
For example: POETRY SPRING 1902: Rainer Maria Rilke.
Each submission should consist of one file (.TXT, .DOCX, or .PDF are
all fine)
and sent as an email attachment. Please do not copy your writing directly into the body of your email.
In your cover letter, be sure to include a short bio (max. 100 words) written in the third person.
