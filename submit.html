Submission guidelines
</h2>
<p>
We have two submission periods: 1 January to 31 March for our spring issue,
and 1 July to 30 September for our fall issue.
Submissions outside these windows will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
You may submit any previously unpublished writing in English, French, or Spanish.
Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere. We aim to respond to
all submissions within three months.
</p>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to four poems of any length per call.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prose:</b> Please submit only one prose piece per call.
We accept both short fiction and creative non-fiction (in your cover letter,
please tell us which category your work falls under). For prose we have a soft limit of 3000 words; that is,
we will not automatically disregard work exceeding this word count, but please understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.
</p>
<p>
Submissions that are sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or racist will be rejected immediately.
</p>
<p>
Please send your submission to ahoyliterary@gmail.com with the subject line formatted as follows:
<p>
<p class="center">
<code>[PROSE/POETRY] [SPRING/FALL] [YEAR]: [Your name]</code>
</p>
<p>
For example: POETRY SPRING 1907: Rainer Maria Rilke. If you wish to submit both prose and poetry during
one submission call, please send two separate emails.
Each submission should consist of one file (.TXT, .DOCX, or .PDF are
all fine)
and sent as an email attachment. Do not copy your writing directly into the body of your email.
In your cover letter, be sure to include a short bio (max. 100 words) written in the third person.
