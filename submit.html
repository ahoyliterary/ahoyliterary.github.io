We have two submission periods: one beginning in <b>February</b> for our summer issue,
and one beginning in <b>August</b> for our winter issue. Submissions normally stay open for 2-3 months
until we have enough submissions. Check our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ahoyliterary/">Instagram</a>
page for up-to-date information.
</p>
<p>
If you are thinking of submitting your work, please note the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing must be previously unpublished and written in either English or French.
    Poetry submissions may also be written in Portuguese. (We regret that we are no longer able
    to accept submissions in Spanish.)</li>
    <li>We read submissions <b>blind</b>, so make sure your name does not appear anywhere in the submitted
        manuscript.</li>
    <li>Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
        inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere.</li>
    <li>We will not publish the same author two issues in a row.
        Hence if you were published in Issue <i>N</i> for some
        <i>N</i>, we ask you not to submit to Issue <i>N</i>&nbsp;+&thinsp;1. You are welcome
    (and encouraged) to submit again after that.</li>
    <li>Submissions that are sexist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, or generated by artificial
        intelligence will be rejected immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to <b>four</b> poems of any length per call. Longer poems may
be harder to place.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fiction and creative nonfiction:</b>
For these submissions we have a soft limit of <b>3000 words;</b> that is,
we will not automatically disregard work exceeding this word count, but do understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.</li>
</p>
<p>
<b>Art:</b>
We accept submissions across mediums including&mdash;but not limited to&mdash;photography,
printmaking, visual research, film stills, photos of installation work.
The work will be presented on an <b>even number</b> of pages and should
ideally span between <b>four to eight pages</b>. Only one body of work may be submitted per call.
</p>

[Submissions are currently closed. When submissions open again, you'll find links to the submission
form here.]
</p>
--->

<p>Once you have verified that your submission adheres to the guidelines above, please send
it to us using one of the following forms.
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/T2TuC4bHj8d84nRi8">Ahoy Issue 5 Submission Form (Poetry)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/3SkMP6b9TGpjfkoL8">Ahoy Issue 5 Submission Form (Fiction/CNF)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/U7GHZV5GPNu8b6p99">Ahoy Issue 5 Submission Form (Art)</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you wish to submit both prose and poetry during
one submission call, please fill two separate forms.
These will be assessed separately; i.e.,
if you receive a rejection for the poetry piece, this does not mean the prose has been rejected.
Please send at most <b>one</b>
submission of prose and at most <b>one</b> submission of poetry per submission call. If you submit more
than once in a given category, only the first entry will be considered.
You may <b>not</b> submit both fiction and creative non-fiction in the same call.
