We have two submission periods: one beginning in <b>February</b> for our summer issue,
and one beginning in <b>August</b> for our winter issue. Submissions normally stay open for 2-3 months
until we have enough submissions. Check our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ahoyliterary/">Instagram</a>
page for up-to-date information.
</p>
<p>
If you are thinking of submitting your work, please note the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing must be previously unpublished and written in either English or French.</li>
    <li>Simultaneous submissions are permitted, but please
        inform us immediately if a piece under our consideration is accepted elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Submissions that are sexist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, or generated by artificial
        intelligence will be rejected immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Poetry:</b> You may submit up to <b>four</b> poems of any length per call. Longer poems may
be harder to place.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fiction and creative nonfiction:</b>
For these submissions we have a soft limit of <b>3000 words;</b> that is,
we will not automatically disregard work exceeding this word count, but do understand that longer
pieces are generally harder to place.</li>
</p>
<p>
<b>Art:</b>
We accept submissions across mediums including&mdash;but not limited to&mdash;photography,
printmaking, visual research, film stills, photos of installation work.
The work will be presented on an <b>even number</b> of pages and should
ideally span between <b>four to eight pages</b>. Only one body of work may be submitted per call.
</p>

Submissions are currently closed. When submissions open again, you'll find links to the submission
form here.
</p>
--->

<p>Once you have verified that your submission adheres to the guidelines above, please send
it to us using one of the following forms.
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/VckkJg2rnW3Zr3xWA">Ahoy Issue 4 Submission Form (Poetry)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/UoX2HNXN94SHdBB88">Ahoy Issue 4 Submission Form (Fiction/CNF)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/GGwZNNt1N2o5CfS58">Ahoy Issue 4 Submission Form (Art)</a></li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
If you wish to submit both prose and poetry during
one submission call, please fill two separate forms. These will be assessed separately; i.e.,
if you receive a rejection for the poetry piece, this does not mean the prose has been rejected.
You may <b>not</b> submit both fiction and creative non-fiction in the same call.
